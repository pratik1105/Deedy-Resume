EXPERIENCE

FUZZY LOGIX
Software Engineering intern, Linear Algebra Optimization 
May 2017 – July 2017 | Bangalore, IN

Optimized Linear Algebra subroutines such as Matrix Multiplication, QR-Factorization,
LU-Factorization, LU-Inverse.
Integrated open source libraries such as OPENBLAS and Industrial library such as Intel’s MKL.
Performance tests for comparison with native system optimized libraries.

FUZZY LOGIX HACKATHON
